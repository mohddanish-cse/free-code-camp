# Basic HTML & HTML5

## Introduction to HTML5 Elements
HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags.
These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.

These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.

## Anchor Tag
To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus
the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to,
usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the element
you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.<br>

- `target="_blank"` causes the linked document to open in a new window tab.
